Very kewl (not) Twitch bot

## Roadmap
Just some small things I might do later on

* Timers for chat spam (e.g. Discord server invitation ResidentSleeper)
* Some basic web UI for managing timers
* Figure out how to do API with multiple bots
* ChatClient wrapper to isolate channels from each other
* More utility commands
* Channel Reward for Points
* Pleblist (own playlist + requests; YouTube & SoundCloud)
